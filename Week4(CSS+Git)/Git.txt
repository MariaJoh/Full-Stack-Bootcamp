# Local Workflow
    - 3 areas:
        - Working directory: Where a developer makes changes
        - Staging area: Holds files with changes to be saved/committed
        - Local repository (.git)

# Steps to upload a project (repository) on GitHub
    - GitHub:
        - Create a new remote repository
            - name: Name of the project
            - description: Description of the project
            - visibility: Private/Public
                - Public (open source)
            - README.md: Project description file
        - Local:
            - First time:
                - git init: Initialize a local git repository (FIRST TIME ONLY)
                - git add: Stage files
                    - git add file1.html: Stage file1.html
                    - git add .: Stage all files
                - git commit -m "Message (describe your changes here)"
