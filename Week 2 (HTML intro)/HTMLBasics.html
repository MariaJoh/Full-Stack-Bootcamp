    <h2>Latte</h2>
    <p>
      Ingredients: Espresso + steamed milk + light milk foam <br>
      How it’s made:<br>
      1. Pull a shot (or two) of espresso.<br>
      2. Steam milk until it’s hot and has a silky texture.<br>
      3. Pour the steamed milk into the espresso, holding back most of the foam.<br>
      4. Top with a thin layer of milk foam.<br>
      Ratio: ~1 part espresso : 4–6 parts steamed milk.<br>
      Creamy, smooth, and milk-forward.<br>

    <h2>Cappuccino</h2>
    <p>
      Ingredients: Espresso + steamed milk + thick milk foam<br>
      How it’s made:<br>
      1. Pull a shot of espresso.<br>
      2. Steam milk so it has more foam (lighter, airier texture than a latte).<br>
      3. Pour the steamed milk over the espresso, aiming for equal parts espresso, milk, and foam.<br>
      Ratio: ~1 part espresso : 1 part steamed milk : 1 part foam.<br>
      Stronger coffee flavor than a latte, with a fluffy texture.<br>
